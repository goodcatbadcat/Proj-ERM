ERM_germany.0.t:0 "The German Empire in 1944"
ERM_germany.0.d:0 "After nearly five years of uninterrupted war, Germany's fortunes have sunk low. \n\nIn the East, the bulk of the Wehrmacht is desperately trying to hold an enormous front that stretches from the Arctic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. The German armies remain deep inside Russia, but the last winter brought defeats at Kursk and in the Ukraine and the loss of much of the army's vaunted Panzer forces.\n\nAnd now this summer on the anniversary of Operation Barbarossa the Soviet's have prepared to launch a vast offensive against the 'Byelorussian Balcony' threatening the destruction of Army Group Centre whilst our allies to the south have begun to waver and look for a way out of the war\n\nIn the west, the Allies have forced a landing in Normandy and are preparing to break out into the vast, nearly unguarded space of occupied France, while in Italy Rome has fallen and the allies threaten to break through into Austria and Southern Germany. \N\NHow Long can Germany hold up under the pressure of this three-front war, combined with an ever-intensifying strategic bombing campaign?"
ERM_germany.0.a:0 "Germany will prevail!"
ERM_germany.1.t:0 "Operation Panzerfaust Success!"
ERM_germany.1.d:0 "Mein Führer,\n\n Operation Panzerfaust has been a great success! As the corrupt admiral Miklós Horthy was working against very own nation by attempting to surrender it to the evil Bolshevik's Otto Skorzeny kidnapped his son rolled him up and shipped him to Vienna where afterward Skorzeny brazenly led a convoy of German troops and four King Tiger tanks to the gates of Horthy's palace. \n\nKnowing he could not resist the might of our forces and his son held as our hostage the old admiral surrendered and with our help the Arrow Cross Party led by Ferenc Szálasi has assumed power."
ERM_germany.1.a:0 "Wonderful news!"
ERM_germany.2.t:0 "Operation Margarethe II Success!"
ERM_germany.2.d:0 "Mein Führer,\n\n Operation Margarethe has been a success! While the corrupt monarchy of Romania attempted to surrender their people to the Bolshevik's  several divisions of the Wehrmacht swiftly seized control of the nation as Skorzeny's specialist troops seized Bucharest freezing the Romanian Government apparatus and capturing the monarch Michael I forcing him to abdicate. \N\NIn his place Ion Antonescu has been firmly secured and placed as the leader of Romania. No more shall we have to worry about the treacherous dealings of monarchs. Romania has been secured as a German ally to the bitter end!"
ERM_germany.2.a:0 "Great news"
ERM_germany.3.t:0 "Finland Signs Armistice!"
ERM_germany.3.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer, \n\n I regretfully must inform you of the treacherous situation in Finland, Marshal Mannerheim has sent us a letter it reads... \n\n 'Our German brothers-in-arms will forever remain in our hearts. The Germans in Finland were certainly not representatives of foreign despotism but helpers and brothers-in-arms. But even in such cases foreigners are in difficult positions requiring such tact. I can assure you that during the past years nothing whatsoever happened that could have induced us to consider the German troops intruders or opressors. I believe that the attitude of the German Army in northern Finland towards the local population and authorities will enter history as a unique example of a correct and cordial relationship...I deem it my duty to lead my people out of the war. I cannot and will not turn the arms which you have so liberally supplied us against Germans. I harbour the hope that you, even if you disapprove of my attitude, will wish and endeavour like myself and all other Finns to terminate our formers relations without increasing the gravity of the situation.' - C.G.E Mannerheim"
ERM_germany.3.a:0 "So much for being 'brothers'..."
ERM_germany.4.t:0 "The Evacuation of Lappland"
ERM_germany.4.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer, \n\n With the exit of Finland from the war we have ourselves a new strategic situation that needs your attention in Lappland. We have ourselves two important possible choices...\n\n#1 Slowly Evacuate Lappland \n\n By slowly evacuating we can take our time and gather all of our arms so that we can send the vast majority of them back home to Germany for the war effort. Unfortunatley this means we will also be for a time violating the neutrality of Finland given our extended stay will not be welcomed by the Soviets who will pressure the Finns to have us removed and we will effectively be at war with Finland potentially\n\n#2 Quickly Evuacate \n\n We can choose to quickly evacuate, this will mean we won't have to be in Finnish territory for long and violate their neutrality however we will also lose the vast majority of the equipment we have up there."
ERM_germany.4.a:0 "Evacuate slowly, I want that equipment saved!"
ERM_germany.4.b:0 "Evacuate quickly, we don't need another potential war"
ERM_germany.5.t:0 "Soviets Overrun Lappland!"
ERM_germany.5.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer, \n\n Bad news from the front, as we were evacuating Lappland our troops were unable to hold the lines and the Soviet's have overran our forces up there. Because of this we have lost the vast majority of our equipment we were hoping to salvage."
ERM_germany.5.a:0 "Damn!"
ERM_germany.6.t:0 "Lappland Evacuation Success!"
ERM_germany.6.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer, \n\n Good news to share! The evacuation in Lappland has been finally completed, the vast majority of the equipment has been salvaged and the last of it has arrived in our friendly ports today to use against the Bolshevik beast!"
ERM_germany.6.a:0 "Great"
ERM_germany.7.t:0 "Lappland Evacuation Success!"
ERM_germany.7.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer, \n\n Good news to share! The evacuation in Lappland has been finally completed, the vast majority of the equipment has been salvaged and the last of it has arrived in our friendly ports today to use against the Bolshevik beast!"
ERM_germany.7.a:0 "Great"
ERM_germany.8.t:0 "Romanian War Support Wavering"
ERM_germany.8.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer, \n\nI come to inform you that from all the intelligence we have gathered as of late points to a troubling situation in Romania. I fear that if the Red Army drives any deeper into their territory their national resolve will break and they will sign a separate peace. \n\nFor this we have two options, to let this happen or to try our best to prevent the collapse of the Romanian state by a Pro-German Coup in which we wipe out and purge any pro-monarchists and any other non Fascist or National Socialist political leaders. If we were to do this we would need to station several divisions across Romania in order to successfully and smoothly carry out the coup"
ERM_germany.8.a:0 "We must take action, but do we have the time and resources?"
ERM_germany.9.t:0 "Hungarian Regent Horthy Engages in Peace Talks!"
ERM_germany.9.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer, \n\nI come with important news! The Hungarian Regent Miklós Horthy has been caught by our intelligence agents to be engaging in ongoing peace talks with none other than the barbaric Bolshevik State of evil! \n\nSomething must be done, the fact is that Operation Margarethe I has already been implemented so we have a lot of control over the nation militarily. However, to go in with force will be prudent, it would be wiser to execute a plan to make Horthy cede power to who we want in control of Hungary. \n\nIt would be a strategic disaster to let Hungary fall into Soviet hands without a fight, it should be avoided at all cost!"
ERM_germany.9.a:0 "He needed to be replaced anyway..."
ERM_germany.10.t:0 "The Baltic Issue"
ERM_germany.10.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer! \n\nWith the looming Soviet occupation of the Baltic States we thought it wisest to inform you of the importance of keeping our presence in the Baltics. \n\nKarl Donitz believes that it is necessary to keep one of the many existing ports in the Baltics for the reason of submarine training as Allied bombing raids have made it difficult to conduct such operations in our westernmost ports. \n\nEven more importantly than training bases however, if we are to leave the Baltics completely it may be that Sweden will either stop trading with us compeltely or even join the war against us if they sense we have lost our influence in the region. We must keep this last vital trade relation alive and prevent them from potentially joining the war against us!"
ERM_germany.10.a:0 "A tough situation indeed..."
ERM_germany.11.t:0 "Soviet Troops Enter Germany!"
ERM_germany.11.d:0 "Mein Führer! \n\nA dark day indeed as the first Soviet troops have managed to step foot on German soil, our men are fighting with the utmost vigor to push them back from the borders of the Reich and as one town was liberated many civilians were found dead. \n\nThis incident will be perfect for the propaganda ministry, there is no doubt that the German people's resolve to fight on until the end will strengthen once they learn of the Soviet's War Crimes!"
ERM_germany.11.a:0 "Is the end so near?"
ERM_germany.12.t:0 "The Eastern Refugee Crisis"
ERM_germany.12.d:0 "Mein Fuhrer! \n\n A very important decision must be made today, the approaching Red Army who has now stepped foot on German soil has stirred up a lot of panic amongst the German populace living in the East who are now starting to flee for their lives. \n\n The issue with this is that this influx of refugees has clogged up our convoy capacity to transfer troops and supplies. On one hand we can choose to continue assisting the evacuation of the civilians or we can make them a military priority and severely limit the evacuation of civilians by critically needed convoys. However, if we choose to do so it will be an incredibly bad look for the government! The people will lose faith in us, our ideology and party was founded by the idea of Germany and German people first! If we abandon them now we will lose a great deal of legitimacy, respect, and authority."
ERM_germany.12.a:0 "Let them continue using the convoys"
ERM_germany.12.b:0 "We cannot spare the convoys for them"
ERM_germany.13.t:0 "Rommel Injured!"
ERM_germany.13.d:0 "Mein Führer, \n\n Today as Rommel was returning from visiting the headquarters of the 1st SS Panzer Corps, a British fighter pilot strafed his staff car. The driver sped up and attempted to get off the main roadway but a 20mm round shattered his left arm causing the vehicle to veer of the road and crash into a group of trees. Herr Rommel was thrown out of the car and suffered injuries to his face from the glass and three fractures to his skull. The head injuries are assumed to be by the doctors 'certainly fatal' however we have hope we will recover."
ERM_germany.13.a:0 "Keep it on the down low for morale"
ERM_germany.1301.t:0 "The Death of Rommel"
ERM_germany.1301.d:0 "A somer day indeed, Herr Rommel has passed away as a 'result of his prior injuries' and has received an extravagant funeral for all his bravery and duties to the state. The Fuhrer has issued an official day of mourning in commemoration of his death."
ERM_germany.1301.a:0 "Rest in Peace"
ERM_germany.14.t:0 "The Valkyrie Plot"
ERM_germany.14.d:0 "With the war coming to an unfavourable end which is hard to deny for any true strategist there comes rumours of a plot behind the shadows to overthrow the current government by using an old plan under the name of Operation Valkyrie which is only supposed to be used in a case of serious domestic turblence to keep control of the populace and the potential rebellion of foreign slave workers brought to Germany. \N\N However, in order for the plan to succeed, Hitler must die, the soldiers are bound to him by oath and they can only be freed from that oath by his death. \n\n It is up to you whether you shall chart a new path or stay loyal to the Fuhrer and fight until the bitter end!"
ERM_germany.14.a:0 "The Führer shall not be betrayed!"
ERM_germany.14.b:0 "Germany must chart a new path if it shall survive"
ERM_germany.15.t:0 "July 20th Plot Fails!"
ERM_germany.15.d:0 "Today at around 12:42 a bomb detonated in the Wolf's Lair as Hitler and several other members of the high command were going over military plans. It is quite lucky that the briefcase bomb was accidently moved by one of the men behind a thin wooden table lag which had blocked much of the blast from the Führer and left him with minimal injuries. Unfortunately however there were four casualties in the ordeal. \N\N The chaotic attempt of a coup did not last long with Hitler phoning in later that day and the coup members realizing he was still alive, many tried to save their own skins and had begun to turn on eachother like the rats they are!"
ERM_germany.15.a:0 "Let the arrests begin"
ERM_germany.1501.t:0 "The Show Trials Begin"
ERM_germany.1501.d:0 "Mein Führer, \N\N It is my pleasure to inform you that the Gestapo has arrested many thousands of suspected involved individuals in the plot and the loyal judge Roland Freisler has begun giving out sentences to those involved the majority being that of death sentences. \n\nBy your direct orders they shall be hung with a meat hook and a thin hemp rope, these men do not deserve any pity or honor for what they have done!"
ERM_germany.1501.a:0 "Good!"
ERM_germany.1502.t:0 "The Show Trials Begin"
ERM_germany.1502.d:0 "Sir, \N\N It is my pleasure to inform you that the Gestapo has arrested many thousands of suspected involved individuals in the plot and the loyal judge Roland Freisler has begun giving out sentences to those involved the majority being that of death sentences. \n\nBy your direct orders they shall be hung with a meat hook and a thin hemp rope, these men do not deserve any pity or honor for what they have done!"
ERM_germany.1502.a:0 "Good!"
ERM_germany.16.t:0 "Valkyrie Coup Succeeds!"
ERM_germany.16.d:0 "A seismic shift has occurred in the heart of our nation. The Führer, Adolf Hitler, is no more, and a group of conspirators - known as the Valkyrie plotters - have seized control in Berlin. The capital is in turmoil, the government is in disarray, and the future of our nation hangs in the balance.\n\nIn this moment of uncertainty, Panzer General Heinz Guderian, training forces near the capital, has taken the initiative. Racing towards Berlin with his loyal professional panzer forces, he stands as a possible leader to guide our nation through these troubled times. Yet, a Nazi counter coup also lies in wait, ready to seize this opportunity.\n\nAs our nation stands on the precipice, it is time to decide who shall lead us into the future. Will it be the Valkyrie plotters, Heinz Guderian, or the Nazi counter coup? The choice we make now will shape the destiny of our nation."
ERM_germany.16.a:0 "Fromm must take charge"
ERM_germany.16.b:0 "Beck must take charge"
ERM_germany.16.c:0 "Heinz Guderian assembles his Panzer forces to ride for Berlin"
ERM_germany.16.e:0 "A Nazi counter coup occurs"
#ERM_germany.16.t:0 "Festung Breslau!"
#ERM_germany.16.d:0 "With the threat of further advancement from the Red Army the Führer has declared Breslau to be a fortress (festung) today ordering that it shall be defended at ALL costs. Karl Hanke the Gauleiter of Silesia will be the city's 'Battle Commander'"
#ERM_germany.16.a:0 "It shall not fall"
ERM_germany.17.t:0 "Reinforce the East or West?"
ERM_germany.17.d:0 "Mein Führer,\n\nAs the conflict intensifies, we are faced with a crucial strategic decision. We find ourselves at a crossroads, with the future of our nation hanging in the balance...\n\nFocus on the Eastern Front\n\nThe strength of the Red Army is undeniable and presents an immediate and substantial threat to our cause. Their numbers, resolve, and strategic positioning necessitate our full attention. As such, it is clear that we must concentrate our forces and resources to counteract this formidable adversary on the Eastern Front. Victory in the East is vital for our survival and could potentially tip the scales of the war in our favor.\n\nReinforce the Western Front\n\nAlternatively, we could consider reinforcing our positions on the Western Front. While the immediate threat of the Red Army is clear, we must not underestimate the combined forces of the Allies. Strengthening our defenses in the West could prevent further incursions into our homeland, buying us valuable time and resources, and allowing us to maintain a balanced approach in this two-front war."
ERM_germany.17.a:0 "It is a tough choice"
ERM_germany.18.t:0 "Goering Proposes Construction of Drug Fabrication Plant"
ERM_germany.18.d:0 "Mein Führer,\n\nHerr Goering has proposed the construction of a dihydrocodeine plant in order to satisfy his needs for pain relief. As you may be aware, his health issues have been worsening, and this powerful analgesic could provide him the necessary respite to continue fulfilling his duties.\n\nHowever, this proposition would mean that we would have to divert precious resources that are otherwise being spent on defending the Reich to instead helping battle Goering's drug withdrawls"
ERM_germany.18.a:0 "Drugs are a hell of a thing"
ERM_germany.18.b:0 "Approve the project"
ERM_germany.19.t:0 "Creation of the Volkssturm"
ERM_germany.19.d:0 "Mein Führer,\n\nThe time has come to awaken the spirit of our Fatherland! The Volkssturm, the People's Storm, has been summoned. Men from all walks of life, young and old, have answered the call, ready to lay down their lives for our beloved nation. \n\nThis is a testament to the indomitable will of our people, their unwavering courage, and their unyielding loyalty. The Volkssturm stands as a bulwark against our enemies, a force of patriots willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. Let the world witness the might of the German people! The Volkssturm, our final line of defense, is ready to confront any adversary. We shall fight in the cities, in the towns, in the fields, and in the forests. We shall never surrender!"

ERM_germany.24.d:0 "Mein Führer,\n\nIn these challenging times of 1944, our Propaganda Ministry has undertaken a grand project. They are producing the film 'Kolberg', a venture that requires substantial resources, even pulling men from the front lines. This endeavor is not without its controversy, yet it is hoped that the film will serve a greater purpose. The aim is to inspire and uplift the morale of our people, to convince them of the worthiness of our cause and to encourage them to hold out steadfastly in the face of adversity."
ERM_germany.24.a:0 "Is it really worth the resources?"
ERM_germany.25.t:0 "Kolberg Movie Complete"
ERM_germany.25.d:0 "Mein Führer,\n\nAfter much anticipation, the film 'Kolberg' has finally been completed and released.
